Billie smiled and stared. Not at any one of the other soldiers. Her gaze landed just beyond Switch. Switch was second only to Billie in terms of the Hybrid Self Smart Contractor. Her gaze landed landed nowhere in particular. While the half dozen grunts sat in stoic desolation, confused but eager, chomping at the bit to not sit no longer, each one greedy for the chance to die. While they gazed at their huds, Billie lost herself in wonder. Just for a moment. Where was her Hybrid Self Smart taking her now? Why the hell would a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation want to communicate directly with Ross William Ulbricht? Billie Shaftoe stared at nothing in particular and basking in the exctacy of it all. She had come full circle now. Somehow. It was beautiful she thought to herself.

She always wondered who Shaun Bridges was, why he was the first Hybrid assigment. Now, the Hybrid Self wanted an audience with Ross Ulbricht. wtf? Full-circle.


At first, having the HSSC implant seemed more like a heavy head than anything. They outlined every detail of every mission. The neuralink offered enlightenment at the speed of light. She couldn't hack it. Nowadays, it wasn't trust. It was some kind of symbiotic ecstacy. The decisions they made needed no justification. What will be always was. That's how she described it to Switch before the Switch Switched. Now, 2 years later, she's running missions exclusively with HSS Contractors.

She never felt the need for any more backup. Switch was plenty, even before Switch upgraded to a HSSC. Now, she wasn't so sure of herself. How the hell could she be sure of anything when the Federal HSSCs started hacking other Federal HSSCs. Billie was happy to only answer
