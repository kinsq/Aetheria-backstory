Spooky action at a distance. That is what Einstein said of it. Ironically, people thought he was referring to distance over space. In reality, the distance was, as Einstein knew full well, both time and space. The efforts of [see citation] led to the implementation of quantum time tunnels that smart contracts began to exploit in Neuralinked subjects in late [~1.5 years from now] They took advantage of the effect and basically preemted thought. thought is separability bound by the Duan quantity. So, a smart contract was able to gather information from nanoseconds in the future and determine the thought of the Neurallink subject. This is where Bob Rife stepped in.... and the mind virus began.

"evading the quantum back-action by 8 decibels on both of them, obtaining a total noise within a factor of 2 of the full quantum limit. This facilitates the detection of weak forces and the generation and measurement of nonclassical motional states of the "
